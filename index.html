            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Melissa Alcaraz, and I am passionate about running. For me, running is more than just a sport; it's a way to stay active, improve my mental health, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
            I started running because it helped me relieve stress during a busy time in my life, and over time, it became an essential part of my daily routine. 
            Whether itâ€™s a short jog in the park or training for a marathon, running helps me feel energized, clear-minded, and focused. I hope this website can inspire others to start their own running journey!</p>
