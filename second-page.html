            <h3>The Benefits of Running</h3>
            <p>Running is one of the most accessible forms of exercise, and it brings numerous benefits. Regular running can significantly enhance cardiovascular health, boost energy levels, and help maintain a healthy weight. 
            Additionally, it strengthens muscles, improves lung function, and promotes overall physical and mental well-being.</p>

            <p>Beyond the physical benefits, running is known for its positive effects on mental health. It helps reduce stress and anxiety, boosts mood, and increases mental clarity. 
            This is due to the release of endorphins, often called "happiness hormones," which naturally enhance your mood and provide a sense of calm and relaxation. 
            Running encourages discipline and perseverance, helping runners set and achieve personal milestones.</p>
